SpecWeave project. Small requests live in the intent board; scoped work lives in increments under `.specweave/increments/NNNN-slug/`. `spec.md` (Problem, ACs, Approach) is the source of truth; the ledger records who did what. This file is for Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini, Aider and humans; Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md (same content). Keep it under one page; project-specific notes go in **Project notes** at the bottom.

<!-- SW:SECTION:structure version="2.2.2" -->
## Structure

```
.specweave/
  intents/board.jsonl       append-only intent history (latest revision per id; planning state, not verification)
  increments/NNNN-slug/   spec.md (Problem · ACs · Approach) · tasks.md (tasks + rendered board) · ledger.jsonl (claims/done, CLI-written) · handoff.md · reports/ (evidence; binaries in reports/artifacts/, gitignored)
  docs/                    ADRs and hand-written docs (read before changing architecture)
  config.json
```
Only those files (plus optional `plan.md` when Approach outgrows a page, and `scripts/`) live in an increment root; everything else goes in `reports/`. Commit messages start with the increment id: `0042: add login form`.

`tasks.md` format (the CLI parses it): `### T-01 Title` followed by one line `- AC: AC-01, AC-02 | Files: src/login.ts, src/login.test.ts | Test: npm test -- login`. `ledger.jsonl` is one JSON object per line, append-only: `{"t":"T-01","e":"claim|done|skip|release|block","by":"<tool>@<host>","at":"<ISO>","evidence":"<sha>","note":"<why>"}` (`evidence` required for `done`, `note` required for `skip`, both optional elsewhere).

<!-- SW:SECTION:loop version="2.2.2" -->
## The loop

| Step | Command (each step is also a standalone skill you can install into any tool with `npx vskill install anton-abyzov/specweave/sw-do` — same for `sw-increment`, `sw-review`, `sw-handoff`, `sw-task`) |
|---|---|
| Plan a feature: write `spec.md` (Problem, Scope, `AC-01…` checkboxes, Approach: files that change, order of work, risks, decisions), resolve material scope questions before implementation | `specweave create-increment "title"` |
| Work the tasks | `specweave task next` → `specweave task claim T-NN` → implement → commit (`NNNN: …`) → `specweave task done T-NN --run "<test cmd>"` (the command runs through your OS shell: cmd.exe on Windows, sh elsewhere) |
| Verify the whole increment | `specweave verify` |
| Review before closing (recommended for anything that ships) | in a fresh session: read spec.md, list findings by severity citing path:line, re-verify each before writing `reports/review.md`; the authoring session never approves its own work |
| Close (needs a green verify or `--reason "<why>"`) | `specweave complete NNNN` |
| Stop for any reason | `specweave handoff` |

Without the `specweave` CLI: create the folder by hand (id = highest existing 4-digit prefix + 1, zero-padded); append one JSON line per event to `ledger.jsonl` as UTF-8 without BOM, LF-terminated, e.g. `{"t":"T-01","e":"claim","by":"<tool>@<host>","at":"<ISO>"}` (bash: `>>`; PowerShell: `[IO.File]::AppendAllText('ledger.jsonl', $line + "`n")`, never `>>`, it writes UTF-16); mark done with the same line using `"e":"done","evidence":"<commit sha>"` after the Test command exits 0; write `reports/verify.md` with the real test output and say the increment is ready to close (closing itself needs the CLI).
Use an increment for work that needs shared scope, acceptance criteria, or a handoff. Small self-contained fixes can remain a lightweight intent. For bugs, reproduce the failure and add a regression test when it protects behavior. User authorization carries through routine implementation and verification.

<!-- SW:SECTION:verify version="2.2.2" -->
## Verification before "done"

Run the project's build/test/lint (see **Commands**) before reporting any task complete and paste the real output. A task is done only when its **Test** command exits 0. Never skip, weaken, or delete a test to make it pass. Never set `status: completed` by hand; use `specweave complete`.
<!-- SW:END:verify -->

<!-- SW:SECTION:parallel version="2.2.2" -->
## Working in parallel (any tool, any account)

1. One worktree per agent, named after the agent: `git worktree add ../NNNN-<agent> -b inc/NNNN-<agent>` (e.g. `../0042-codex -b inc/0042-codex`). The branch name must contain the increment id.
2. Claim before editing: `specweave task claim T-NN` (or `specweave task next`). Edit only that task's **Files**; need another file → claim its task or add a task. A claim older than 2h with no `done` is stale and may be re-claimed.
3. Never edit ledger lines or another task's status; append only. On a git conflict in `ledger.jsonl` keep every line from both sides.
4. `done` needs the task's **Test** command exit 0 and a commit sha. A task that turns out unnecessary is closed with `specweave task skip T-NN --reason "..."` (no CLI: append a `skip` ledger line with a reason), never ticked.
5. When you stop: `specweave task release --all-mine` then `specweave handoff`.
Resuming: check `.specweave/intents/board.jsonl` (latest revision per id) or `specweave dashboard` for unfinished intents, including work without an increment. Then find the active increment with `specweave status` (or the `NNNN-*` folder whose `metadata.json` has `"status": "active"`), read `spec.md`, then the latest `handoff.md`, then `specweave task next`.

<!-- SW:SECTION:conventions version="2.2.2" -->
## Conventions

- Secrets: confirm a key is present without printing its value (`grep -q NAME .env` or `Select-String -Quiet NAME .env`); never commit `.env*`.
- Prefer deleting code over adapting it; change only what the task needs.
- Check `.specweave/docs/` ADRs before architectural changes; record new decisions in spec.md **Approach** or an ADR. When a new increment replaces an old one, create it with `--supersedes NNNN` (or set `supersedes` in its metadata.json) instead of leaving the old one open.

<!-- SW:SECTION:troubleshooting version="2.2.2" -->
## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `specweave` not found | `npm i -g specweave` (optional; the loop works without it) |
| Instructions out of date after upgrade | `specweave update` |
| Unsure who owns a task | `specweave task list` |
<!-- SW:END:troubleshooting -->

## Commands

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Build | TODO: not detected — fill in the build command |
| Test | TODO: not detected — fill in the test command |
| Lint | TODO: not detected — fill in the lint command |

If a cell still says TODO, fill it in from `package.json`/`Makefile` and commit; `specweave verify` runs these rows.
