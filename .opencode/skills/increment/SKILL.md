# Plan an Increment

An increment is one folder — `.specweave/increments/NNNN-slug/` — holding
`spec.md` (intent + ACs + approach), `tasks.md` (task definitions),
`ledger.jsonl` (state, written by the CLI) and `metadata.json`. It is the unit of
work and the tracker; every commit for it carries its id in the subject.

## Scope before implementation

Write a concise plan for work that needs shared acceptance criteria. Ask only about
material ambiguity or actions beyond the user's authorization. When the user has
asked for autonomous execution, make routine decisions and continue through
implementation and verification. A small self-contained fix can remain a
lightweight intent without this workflow.

## Steps

1. **Understand the request.** Restate it in one sentence: what changes, for whom, why now.
   - Scope clear enough to write ACs? Go to 2.
   - Not clear (vague goal, unknown users, competing options, unclear done-condition)?
     Interview first — ask only the questions whose answers change the spec, in one batch:
     the problem behind the request, who hits it, what "done" looks like, what is explicitly
     out of scope, constraints (stack, deadline, data), and the riskiest unknown.
     Trivial fix → 0 questions. Do not interview to fill a quota.
2. **Look before writing.** Read `.specweave/config.json` (testing commands, sync,
   `workspace.repos`), skim existing increments for overlap (`specweave status`), and
   read the code the change will touch. An Approach written without reading the files is a guess.
3. **Create the folder** — the CLI owns id allocation (atomic, retried):
   ```
   specweave create-increment --auto-id --name "<kebab-slug>" --title "<Title>" \
     --description "<one line>" --project "<project id from config>" \
     [--type feature|bug|hotfix|refactor] [--supersedes <old-id>]
   ```
   Superseding an older increment: pass `--supersedes <old-id>`. That one command abandons the
   old increment with `closeReason: "superseded by <new-id>"` and records `supersedes` on the new
   one — do not split it into two steps. Name the old id in the new spec's Problem section.
   No CLI: create the folder by hand, put `"supersedes": "<old-id>"` in the new `metadata.json`
   and set the old one to `"status": "abandoned"` with the same `closeReason`.
4. **Write `spec.md`** — one evolving document, these sections:

   ```markdown
   # NNNN — <Title>

   ## Problem
   What is wrong today, for whom, and the evidence (issue, log, user quote). Not the solution.

   ## Scope
   In: … · Out: … (the "out" list is what stops scope creep later.)

   ## Acceptance Criteria
   - [ ] AC-01: <observable, testable outcome — a reviewer can check it without asking you>
   - [ ] AC-02: …

   ## Approach
   Files that change and in what order · key decisions (+ ADR links) · rejected alternatives
   and why · risks and the mitigation.

   ## Open questions
   - <question> — blocking? who decides?
   ```

   ACs are numbered and observable. "Improve performance" is not an AC; "p95 of
   `/search` under 300 ms with 10k rows" is. Keep them to what this increment ships.
   `plan.md` is optional overflow for a genuinely large design — `--with-plan`; the
   Approach section is the default home.
5. **Write `tasks.md`** — definitions only; the ledger holds state:

   ```markdown
   ### T-01 Add the ledger fold
   - AC: AC-01, AC-02 | Files: src/core/tasks/ledger.ts, src/core/tasks/ledger.test.ts | Test: npm test -- ledger
   ```

   `Files:` is the ownership unit — two tasks that edit the same file cannot run in
   parallel, so merge them or add `**Dependencies**: T-NN`. Every AC must be covered by at
   least one task; every task needs a `Test:` that a machine can run (or an explicit
   "manual: <what to check>"). Shared contracts (types, schema, migrations) go in an early
   task everything else depends on.
6. **Share the plan** (problem, ACs, tasks, material risks). Resolve any remaining decision that needs the user; otherwise continue within existing authorization.
7. **Hand off to execution**: `sw:do <id>` for one agent; `sw:team <id>` when the work has
   3+ disjoint lanes or 15+ tasks.

## Rules

- **Never hand-edit `metadata.json` status** — CLI transitions own it. The vocabulary is
  `planned | active | paused | completed | abandoned`; `create-increment` writes `active`
  (use `--planned` for backlog work, then `specweave start <id>` when you pick it up).
- **WIP is advisory.** The CLI prints one note when active increments exceed
  `limits.activeIncrements` (`0` = off). It never blocks; do not invent a cap.
- **One agent plans.** No planning fan-out — a second opinion on a spec costs more than it adds.
- **Umbrella workspaces**: increments live in the umbrella root only. The `Project:` field on
  a user story routes sync to a child repo; never create `.specweave/` inside a child repo.
- **Bug / hotfix increments are still increments** — smaller spec (Problem, one or two ACs,
  Approach), same folder shape. Do not skip the spec because it is "quick".
- If the user says "don't create an increment", respect it and work in the conversation.
