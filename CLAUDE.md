SpecWeave project. Small requests live in the intent board; scoped work lives in increments under `.specweave/increments/NNNN-slug/`. `spec.md` (Problem, ACs, Approach) is the source of truth; the ledger records who did what. Keep this file under one page; project-specific notes go in **Project notes** at the bottom.
<!-- SW:END:header -->

<!-- SW:SECTION:structure version="2.2.2" -->
## Structure

```
.specweave/
  intents/board.jsonl       append-only intent history (latest revision per id; planning state, not verification)
  increments/NNNN-slug/   spec.md (Problem · ACs · Approach) · tasks.md (tasks + rendered board) · ledger.jsonl (claims/done, CLI-written) · handoff.md · reports/ (evidence; binaries in reports/artifacts/, gitignored)
  docs/                    ADRs and hand-written docs (read before changing architecture)
  config.json
```
Only those files (plus optional `plan.md` when Approach outgrows a page, and `scripts/`) live in an increment root; everything else goes in `reports/`. Commit messages start with the increment id: `0042: add login form`.

`tasks.md` format (the CLI parses it): `### T-01 Title` followed by one line `- AC: AC-01, AC-02 | Files: src/login.ts, src/login.test.ts | Test: npm test -- login`. `ledger.jsonl` is one JSON object per line, append-only: `{"t":"T-01","e":"claim|done|skip|release|block","by":"<tool>@<host>","at":"<ISO>","evidence":"<sha>","note":"<why>"}` (`evidence` required for `done`, `note` required for `skip`, both optional elsewhere).

<!-- SW:SECTION:loop version="2.2.2" -->
## The loop

| Step | Command |
|---|---|
| Plan a feature (spec.md with ACs + Approach; resolve material scope questions) | `/sw:increment "title"` |
| Work the tasks (claim → implement → commit → done with evidence) | `/sw:do` (loops `specweave task next` / `claim` / `done --run`) |
| Verify the whole increment | `specweave verify` |
| Review before closing (recommended for anything that ships: fresh context, findings cite path:line and are re-verified) | `/sw:review` |
| Close (needs a green verify or `--reason`) | `/sw:done` |
| Stop for any reason (context, tokens, switching tools) | `/sw:handoff` |

Use an increment for work that needs shared scope, acceptance criteria, or a handoff. Small self-contained fixes can remain a lightweight intent. For bugs, reproduce the failure and add a regression test when it protects behavior. User authorization carries through routine implementation and verification.

<!-- SW:SECTION:verify version="2.2.2" -->
## Verification before "done"

Run the project's build/test/lint (see **Commands**) before reporting any task complete and paste the real output. `specweave task done T-NN --run "<test cmd>"` refuses a failing command. Never skip, weaken, or delete a test to make it pass. Never set `status: completed` by hand; use `/sw:done`.
<!-- SW:END:verify -->

<!-- SW:SECTION:parallel version="2.2.2" -->
## Working in parallel (any tool, any account)

1. One worktree per agent, named after the agent: `git worktree add ../NNNN-<agent> -b inc/NNNN-<agent>` (e.g. `../0042-claude -b inc/0042-claude`) or `claude --worktree NNNN-<agent>`. The branch name must contain the increment id.
2. Claim before editing: `specweave task claim T-NN` (or `specweave task next`). Edit only that task's **Files**; need another file → claim its task or add a task. A claim older than 2h with no `done` is stale and may be re-claimed.
3. Never edit ledger lines or another task's status; append only. On a git conflict in `ledger.jsonl` keep every line from both sides.
4. `done` needs the task's **Test** command exit 0 and a commit sha. A task that turns out unnecessary is closed with `specweave task skip T-NN --reason "..."`, never ticked.
5. When you stop: `specweave task release --all-mine` then `/sw:handoff`.
Resuming: check `.specweave/intents/board.jsonl` (latest revision per id) or `specweave dashboard` for unfinished intents, including work without an increment. Then find the active increment with `specweave status` (or the `NNNN-*` folder whose `metadata.json` has `"status": "active"`), read `spec.md`, then the latest `handoff.md`, then `/sw:do`.

<!-- SW:SECTION:conventions version="2.2.2" -->
## Conventions

- Secrets: confirm a key is present without printing its value (`grep -q NAME .env` or `Select-String -Quiet NAME .env`); never commit `.env*`.
- Prefer deleting code over adapting it; change only what the task needs.
- Check `.specweave/docs/` ADRs before architectural changes; record new decisions in spec.md **Approach** or an ADR. When a new increment replaces an old one, create it with `--supersedes NNNN` instead of leaving the old one open.

<!-- SW:SECTION:troubleshooting version="2.2.2" -->
## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Skills or hooks missing | `specweave doctor`, then `/reload-plugins` (restart if still missing) |
| Instructions out of date after upgrade | `specweave update` |
| Unsure who owns a task | `specweave task list` |

## Commands

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Build | TODO: not detected — fill in the build command |
| Test | TODO: not detected — fill in the test command |
| Lint | TODO: not detected — fill in the lint command |

If a cell still says TODO, fill it in from `package.json`/`Makefile` and commit; `specweave verify` runs these rows.
